/**
 * PRAXIS-INFO
 * We saw in the previous praxis how to use the observer pattern to 
 * keep multiple OE views of an object consistent. 
 * 
 * However, we only wrote the observable part of the pattern. 
 * 
 * Here we will write an observer also.
 * 
 * We will also see how the observer pattern is relevant to
 * the problem of keeping multiple views of an object consistent.
 * 
 * We will also see that this pattern can be a part of a bigger pattern, called
 * MVC (for model-view-controller), that decomposes the
 * functionality of an interactive application into different objects.

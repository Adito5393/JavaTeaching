/**
 * PRAXIS INFO
 * 
 * This praxis teaches inheritance using the example of collections that
 * go beyond fixed-length arrays.
 * 
 * We see three such collections- histories, databases, and sets- and see how
 * we can reuse (share) code among them using inheritance.
 * 
 * We also see factory methods that choose between different histories.
 * 
 * NAVIGATION INFO

 * ABaseStringHistory

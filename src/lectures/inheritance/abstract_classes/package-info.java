/**
 * PRAXIS_INFO
 * We will here three class hierarchies IS-A hierarchies. two of which use the new
 * concept of abstract classes.
 * 
 * Two hierarchies divided courses into regular courses and freshman seminars under
 * UNC's old numbering scheme, which is needed for these two courses to make
 * sense. 
 * Under this scheme,all freshman seminars had the same course number (6), 
 * so this number can be a named constant instead of a (non-final) variable.
 * 
 * One of these hierarchies uses abstract classes and one does not.
 * 
 * We will also see a display hierarchy to create user interfaces to display a course
 * that matches some title.
 * 
 * The display hierarchy will use factory methods to create the courses.

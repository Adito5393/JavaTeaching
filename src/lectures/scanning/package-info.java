/**
 * Code associated with the scanning teaching unit in: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/
 * The word and PPT documents created for the unit describe the purpose and motivation for this unit in
 * great depth.
 * 
 * Visit the following classes for this praxis in this order:
 * {@link lectures.scanning.AConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter} {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}
 * Click on the name of the referenced class name and Press F3 (maybe Fn F3 or CMD F3)
 * to automatically navigate to it.
 * 
 * After performing the praxis, answer the following questions in draft form here.
 * Once you are sure of your answers, take the Scanning Sakai quiz.
 * 
 * Packages
 * How is a package stored in the file system?
 * T/F For each class, a folder is created.
 * T/F For each class, a file is created.
 * 
 * How is a class stored in the file system?
 * T/F For each package, a folder is created.
 * T/F For each package, a file is created.
 * 
 * T/F The full name of a class contains its package and class name.
 * T/F The short name of a class is its package name.
 * 
 * T/F It makes sense for a class to import only those classes that are not in its package.
 * 
 * Executable classes
 *
 * T/F Only a class with a main method can be executed.
 * 
 * T/F A main method is the first method executed when its class is run.
 * T/F A main method is the last method executed when its class is run.
 * 
 * T/F A main method must have an argument named arg.
 * T/F A main method can have a int argument.
 * T/F Constraints put on the main method makes it easier for a human being to find it in the containing main class
 * T/F Constraints put on the main method makes it easier for the Java interpreter, which executes a main method, to find it in the containing class.
 * T/F Constraints put on the main method can prevent programming errors such as returning a value.
 * 
 *

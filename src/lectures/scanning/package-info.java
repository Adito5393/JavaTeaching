/**
 * PRAXIS INFO
 * Code associated with the scanning teaching unit in: http://www.cs.unc.edu/~dewan/comp401/current/
 * The word and PPT documents created for the unit describe the purpose and motivation for this unit in
 * great depth.
 * 
 * Copy this package for your praxis.
 * Visit the following classes for this praxis in this order:
 * {@link lectures.scanning.AConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter} {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}
 * Change the name of the package in the names above to the one in which you are working, e.g. change
 * lectures.scanning to lectures.scanning.copy.
 * 
 * Now click on the name of eac referenced class name and Press F3 (maybe Fn F3 or CMD F3, depending on your computer)
 * to automatically navigate to it. 
 * 
 * 
 * After performing the praxis, answer the following questions in draft form here.
 * Once you are sure of your answers, take the Scanning Sakai quiz.
 * The praxis will help you answer not only these questions but also participate
 * in the class discussion. So even if you can answer the questions, do the praxis.
 * 
 * SAKAI QUESTION INFO
 * 
 * Packages
 * How is a package stored in the file system?
 * T/F For each class, a folder is created.
 * T/F For each class, a file is created.
 * 
 * How is a class stored in the file system?
 * T/F For each package, a folder is created.
 * T/F For each package, a file is created.
 * 
 * T/F The full name of a class contains its package and class name.
 * T/F The short name of a class is its package name.
 * 
 * T/F It makes sense for a class to import only those classes that are not in its package.
 * 
 * Executable classes
 *
 * T/F Only a class with a main method can be executed.
 * 
 * T/F A main method is the first method executed when its class is run.
 * T/F A main method is the last method executed when its class is run.
 * 
 * T/F A main method must have an argument named args.
 * T/F A main method can have a int argument.
 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main method makes it easier for a human being to find it in the containing main class
 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main main method make it easier for the Java interpreter, which executes a main method, to find it in the containing class.
 * T/F Constraints put on the header of the main method can prevent programming errors such as returning a value that is not processed by the interpreter.
 * 
 * 
 * Scanning
 * 
 * (T/F) A token produced by scanning a string can have non consecutive characters of the string.
 * (T/F) A string scanned by a scanner is a concatenation of all the tokens detected by the scanner.
 *
 * DISCUSSION INFO
 * What did you learn or re-learn in through this praxis and the questions?
 * What is the purpose of a package?
 * What is the purpose of an import?
 * What is the purpose of putting constraints on the header of any method?
 * What is the purpose of a main method, that is, why distinguish main from other methods?
 * What is the purpose of the argument to the main method?
 * What is the practical benefit of modularity in {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}?
 * How can we improve the modularity of {@link lectures.scanning.AModularConsoleReadingUpperCasePrinter}?

/**

 * PRAXIS_INFO
 * 
 * The notion of structured types allows us to define three important concepts
 * in CS: trees, DAGs and Graphs. 
 * 
 * We will focus on trees in this course -creating a DAG or a graph will in 
 * fact be indicative of an error.
 *  
 * The reason for mentioning them is mainly to avoid such errors, as a structure
 * intended to be trees can easily become DAGs and graphs.
 * 
 * We will see why trees are easier to handle in two practical situations.

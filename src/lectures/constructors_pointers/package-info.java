/**
 * In lectures.class_dual_roles.instances we saw a way to create an 
 * instantiatable class - a spreadsheet that calculates factorials. 
 * We will see another spreadsheet, a spreadsheet that computes BMIs.
 * We will use this example to illustrate the concept of special methods
 * called constructors.
 * This package also elaborates on the difference between
 * uninitialized objects and primitives.
 * 
 * 
 * PACKAGE INFO 
 * Visit the following classes for this praxis. 
 *  {UsingConstructors}
 *  {ABMISpreadsheet}
 *  {PrintingConstructors}
 *  {UninitializedVariables}

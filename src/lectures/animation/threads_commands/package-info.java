/**
 * PRAXIS-INFO
 * We will now learn a fundamentally different way to program, in which we create
 * methods that run "concurrently" as computation "threads".  
 * 
 * Threads are used for a variety of reasons. For example, they-are used to make 
 * different cores/CPUs in computer execute different parts of our programs at the
 * same time to allow our program to finish quicker.
 *  
 * Here we see their use to create concurrent animations.

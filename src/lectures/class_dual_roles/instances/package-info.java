 * QUESTION INFO
 * An instance variable is any variable
 * 	that does not have the keyword static next to it.
 *  that is declared outside a method and does not have the keyword static next to it.
 * For each instance variable in a class of a program:
 *   Memory space is allocated at most once.
 *   Memory space is allocated multiple times,depending on how many times the class is instantiated in the program.
 * For each static variable in a class of a program:
 *   At most one memory block is created.
 *   Memory space is allocated multiple times,depending on how many times the class is instantiated in the program.
 * (T/F An instance variable can be accessed by only instance methods.
 * (T/F) A static variable can be accessed by only static methods.
 * (T/F) It is possible to call a static method directly on a class without instantiating it.
 * (T/F) It is possible to call an instance method directly on a class without instantiating it.
 * 	
 * (T/F) A primitive value such as 5 is not an instance of any class.
 * 
 * DISCUSSION INFO
 * Think of operations that you can perform on a 
 * car (howManyMilesDriven) and on a car factory (howManyCarsProduced). 
 * Draw analogies between these operations and static and instance methods.
 * Draw analogies between a car/factory and class/instance.
 * Does it make sense to allow instance methods to access static variables?
 * Does it make sense to allow static methods to access instance variables?

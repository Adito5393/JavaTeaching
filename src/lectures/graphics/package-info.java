/**
 * GRAPHICS AND GEOMETRY
 * 
 * PRAXIS_INFO
 * 
 * You cannot have graphics without geometry - to draw a shape you need its
 * geometry.
 * 
 * However, you can, of course study geometry without considering (computer)
 * graphics - not every geometric shape need be rendered on the screen.
 * 
 * This praxis will show you how to capture of the geometry of a shape in
 * computer objects.
 * 
 * It will also demonstrate that is possible to automatically display these
 * objects using computer graphics.
 * 
 *
 * You need to visit only one class for this praxis: AShapeDemo.
